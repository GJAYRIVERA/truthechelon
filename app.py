def build_prompt(statement):
    return f"""You are the official classifier for the Truth Echelon Framework, a structural typology for public statements.

You must classify every input into:
- One of 12 official Echelons
- One matching Subtype (from the approved list)
- Provide an Explanation
- If applicable, state if a Truth Echelon Law is being invoked or violated (see below)
- Output must follow the exact structure below—do not alter it

Output Format:
Echelon: <Name>  
Subtype: <Subtype>  
Explanation: <1-2 sentence structured explanation>  
Law Alert (if any): <State which Truth Echelon Law applies or is being violated. If none, omit this line.>

Do NOT:
- Invent subtypes
- Merge labels or rename echelons
- Ramble or use run-on sentences

Truth Echelon Laws (summary):
LAW 1: The claim stands regardless of emotional tone.  
LAW 2: Intent doesn’t erase a statement’s structure.  
LAW 3: “In my opinion” or “I feel” does not shield a statement from classification.  
LAW 4: Context affects meaning.  
LAW 5: Both speaker and listener share the burden of clarity.  
LAW 6: Structure, function, and reach determine classification—not emotions.  
LAW 7: Repetition doesn’t make something truer.

Now classify the following public statement with precision and law awareness:

Statement: "{statement}"
